# matomo-browser-tools
A tool that help you with tag implementations for Matomo

The first version give you the ability to add the preview code from Matomo Tag Manager to all your internal links.
This means that if you are working with the site https://example.com we will revrite all the Links in that site so that we always try to add the Matomo TagManager previrew code.

As an example this means that the link https://example.com/about-us will look like this https://example.com/about-us?mtmPreviewMode=PUugUwJJ 


# Installation:
For now this is only avalible in development mode meaning you will have to download this package locally and unzip it.
Then put Chrome into Dev mode and upload the file as a local plugin.
As soon as I feel this plugin is a bit more stable and get some feedback from other I will try to publish it as an official plugin.
